    My two passions in life, music and technology, do not seem to have many similarities on the surface. But as I have been delving deeper into the world of coding, I have found that my skills I acquired while studying music transfer seamlessly to my coding projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am currently a professional violinist, and I have my Bachelors and Masters in Violin Performance from   Indiana University. While many classical musicians have other musicians in their families, I am the only one  in my family who plays an instrument, and I am also a first generation college graduate. When I was 8 years   old, my second grade school teacher brought her violin to class to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I  immediately fell in love with the instrument and begged my parents to play. They eventually caved, and asked my school teacher if she could begin lessons with me. Another factor that I feel contributed to my musical career was my local library. They had a fairly large selection of classical music CDs. I eagerly checked out the ones that featured the music I was learning, and I dutifully played along with the recordings at home. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was solidifying what a violin should really sound like in my ears. I now believe that without the access to top rate recordings from the library, I wouldn’t have realized what I was  striving to sound like, and I wouldn’t have progressed the way I did.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my musical professional life, I play chamber music, orchestral music, and I teach violin students of all ages. I feel that teaching has brought me many problem solving opportunities.  Many of my fondest memories are teaching students, seeing them grow and develop over years and years of hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
    As I mentioned earlier, I have increasingly found that the way I approach problem solving on my violin is similar to solving problems with code. I also found that the persistence and grit required to learn an instrument translates into the qualities I need to learn in the huge world of tech. I am addicted to the thrill of building something, whether it’s a data analysis project, or a website with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and I can’t wait to learn and grow with coding so I can build even more.
