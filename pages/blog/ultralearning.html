  I found a fascinating book by Scott H. Young at my local library. It takes a deep dive into how we learn and retain information. This isn’t a new topic, of course, but this book emphasizes learning tough subjects by yourself, and in non traditional environments. As Mr. Young put it, “ultralearning is a strategy for aggressive, self-directed learning”.
  </p>

  The book covers many potential things to learn, from new languages, to chess, to programming. Since I’m a self taught programmer, this really caught my eye. Plus, I’ve always been enticed by how people learn their high level skills, especially with music. I love to read how someone structures their violin practice time, and how they balance working hard with conserving their energy to keep up the practicing over years and years. “Ultralearning” bridged the gap between my long-time interest in practice techniques with my newer interest in learning to code.
  </p>
  <p>
  In my opinion, the key topic covered in the book was retrieval. I think we can all relate to the urge to passively read or watch a video, and feel like we’re done learning. But to really learn things quickly and thoroughly, we need to push ourselves out of our comfort zone and regurgitate the information on our own. If you can teach it someone else, you know you’ve learned the topic. I loved the story about Mary Somerville (1780-1872) who, when denied a candle to study during the night, went over math formulas in her head over and over. While the deck was stacked against Mary, being a woman in the 18th century, her grit and persistence allowed her to find ways to hone her expertise past almost everyone else in Europe.
